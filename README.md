# CNN-for-PD-action
The flow chart of the finger tapping evaluation method proposed in this paper is shown in figure . 

Firstly, the finger tapping test video of PD patients is collected, and then the skeleton data of the hands is extracted by the pose estimation model MediapipeHands[[[2006.10214v1\] MediaPipe Hands: On-device Real-time Hand Tracking (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10214v1)]. 

Subsequently, the feature data based on the motion law of the hands is extracted depending on the method designed in this paper, so as to obtain the one-dimensional time series data. 

Following the data pre-processing such as normalization and cropping alignment, the data are input into the full convolution network(FCN).

## Data 

The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.If necessary, the researcher can send an email to [caimiao1985@126.com](mailto:caimiao1985@126.com).

## Code 

The code is divided as follows: 

* The MediapipeHand.py python file used to extract hand skeleton information. 
* The FCN.py  python file is the network used to evaluate the experiment.
* The Feature.py python file used to extract velocity and amplitude information

To run a model on one dataset you should issue the following command: 

```
python FCN.py 
```

## Prerequisites

All python packages needed are listed in pip-requirements.txt  file and can be installed simply using the pip command. 
The code now uses Tensorflow 1.11.0.
